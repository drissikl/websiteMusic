              Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 ‚Äì 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. He is one of the most 
              revered figures in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the classical music repertoire 
              and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. Beethoven's career has 
              conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, 
              is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual 
              development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. 
              During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations 
              in musical form and expression.

              Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical 
              period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every Western 
              classical genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, 
              chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of 
              Western music, with his music admired for its "melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and 
              texture".

              the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom.

              String instruments also termed stringed or chordophones originate or produce sound from vibrating strings. 
              Performers usually play or pluck the strings of the instruments to produce sound. They use a plectrum or their 
              fingers to create that great sound of the string instruments. <br>
              for example <br>
              Violin, Viola, Cello, Guitar, Autoharp, Banjo, Guitarron, Koto, Oud, Piano, Ukulele, ....
